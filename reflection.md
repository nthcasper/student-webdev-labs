## Reflection Document

### HTML

I was able to complete most of the exercises on my own, but I referred to the provided resources for clarification on certain elements, especially when working with tables and forms. The exercises were helpful in reinforcing fundamental HTML concepts, and I found the form-building exercise particularly useful in understanding different input types and their proper usage.

While the exercises were well-structured, I think a bit more explanation on the best practices for accessibility, such as proper labeling and form validation, would have been beneficial.

### Accessibility

While working on this exercise, I learned how important it is to structure forms properly for accessibility. I realized that simply adding labels is not enough—using for attributes, grouping related inputs with fieldset, and ensuring unique name attributes for radio buttons all play a role in making a form more user-friendly.

One of the most helpful parts was learning how screen readers interpret forms and how small changes, like using legend for radio groups, can improve navigation. I also found that using the correct input types, like type="email", helps with both accessibility and usability.

### CSS

I was able to complete most of the exercises on my own, but I referred to resources when working with specificity and layout. The specificity exercise was particularly helpful because it made me think more critically about how different selectors interact and which rules take precedence. Understanding how ID selectors, classes, attributes, and pseudo-elements contribute to specificity helped clarify why certain styles override others.

### Flexbox
Working on these Flexbox exercises helped me understand how to create flexible, responsive layouts efficiently. I learned how different properties like justify-content, align-items, flex-grow, and flex-wrap work together to control positioning and spacing within a container.

### BootStrap
These Bootstrap exercises helped me understand how to use cards, grids, and modals effectively. The card exercise showed me how to structure content using Bootstrap’s built-in classes. The grid exercises taught me how to create responsive layouts that adjust to different screen sizes. The modal exercise was a great way to see how Bootstrap makes pop-ups easy to use without much coding. Overall, these exercises made me more confident in using Bootstrap, and I want to explore more ways to customize designs.

### Javascript 
This set of exercises helped me connect the dots between different parts of JavaScript, from basic string and array manipulation to working with the DOM and fetching external data. One of the biggest takeaways for me was seeing how these techniques build on each other. For example, working with arrays and objects makes the fetch exercise easier, and knowing how to manipulate the DOM makes the API data actually useful for users.

I feel more confident now moving between pure logic problems (like the object and functional exercises) and interactive browser work (like the DOM and fetch exercises). Moving forward, I want to keep practicing by combining these techniques into small projects, like building a mini app that fetches and displays data dynamically.

### CSS Grid 
The CSS Grid exercises helped me get comfortable with structuring layouts using grid-template-columns/rows and adjusting them with media queries. Naming grid areas made things clearer, and I liked seeing how layouts shift at different screen sizes.
