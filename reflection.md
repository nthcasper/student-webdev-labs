## Reflection Document

### HTML

I was able to complete most of the exercises on my own, but I referred to the provided resources for clarification on certain elements, especially when working with tables and forms. The exercises were helpful in reinforcing fundamental HTML concepts, and I found the form-building exercise particularly useful in understanding different input types and their proper usage.

While the exercises were well-structured, I think a bit more explanation on the best practices for accessibility, such as proper labeling and form validation, would have been beneficial.

### Accessibility

While working on this exercise, I learned how important it is to structure forms properly for accessibility. I realized that simply adding labels is not enoughâ€”using for attributes, grouping related inputs with <fieldset>, and ensuring unique name attributes for radio buttons all play a role in making a form more user-friendly.

One of the most helpful parts was learning how screen readers interpret forms and how small changes, like using <legend> for radio groups, can improve navigation. I also found that using the correct input types, like type="email", helps with both accessibility and usability.

### CSS

I was able to complete most of the exercises on my own, but I referred to resources when working with specificity and layout. The specificity exercise was particularly helpful because it made me think more critically about how different selectors interact and which rules take precedence. Understanding how ID selectors, classes, attributes, and pseudo-elements contribute to specificity helped clarify why certain styles override others.
