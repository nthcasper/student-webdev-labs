## Reflection Document

### HTML

I was able to complete most of the exercises on my own, but I referred to the provided resources for clarification on certain elements, especially when working with tables and forms. The exercises were helpful in reinforcing fundamental HTML concepts, and I found the form-building exercise particularly useful in understanding different input types and their proper usage.

While the exercises were well-structured, I think a bit more explanation on the best practices for accessibility, such as proper labeling and form validation, would have been beneficial.

### Accessibility

While working on this exercise, I learned how important it is to structure forms properly for accessibility. I realized that simply adding labels is not enoughâ€”using for attributes, grouping related inputs with <fieldset>, and ensuring unique name attributes for radio buttons all play a role in making a form more user-friendly.

One of the most helpful parts was learning how screen readers interpret forms and how small changes, like using <legend> for radio groups, can improve navigation. I also found that using the correct input types, like type="email", helps with both accessibility and usability.
