## Reflection Document

### HTML

I was able to complete most of the exercises on my own, but I referred to the provided resources for clarification on certain elements, especially when working with tables and forms. The exercises were helpful in reinforcing fundamental HTML concepts, and I found the form-building exercise particularly useful in understanding different input types and their proper usage.

While the exercises were well-structured, I think a bit more explanation on the best practices for accessibility, such as proper labeling and form validation, would have been beneficial.
